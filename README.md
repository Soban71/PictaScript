PictaScript is an app that lets users upload images or provide an image URL to get descriptive captions. It uses advanced algorithms to analyze images and generate accurate captions. The app is built with React, styled-components, axios, and react-easy-crop for the frontend, and Flask for the backend, to create a smooth and easy-to-use experience.
